There seems to be a slight delay when opening the extension (like 100ms or something)
If you use the keyboard shortcut and then type immediately, the first letter or two might get cut off while loading
Having a background HTML file loads the extension into memory and seems to reduce the delay when opening the extension to almost nothing
