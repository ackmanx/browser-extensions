# Star Gazer White

Chrome's Star Gazer theme is awesome, but the tabs look very gray and sad

This brighten ups things a bit but keeps the same graphics

## Installation

Enable developer mode and load the folder with the manifest to develop

To deploy, just zip the folder and then that zip can be dragged into Chrome's extensions page
