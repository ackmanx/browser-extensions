# Super Small View Switcher

### Purpose
I'm sick of editing `bby_rdp` every time I want to switch between small view and large view. This does it for me.

### Installation
* Clone
* Enable "Developer Mode" in Chrome at `chrome://extensions`
* `Load unpacked extension...` and select `src` folder

### Problems
If the extension isn't working, clear your cookies and go to bestbuy.com to get a new cookie from them.
